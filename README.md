Vala Implementation of Gtk4 ListBox Controls demo. Gnome-builder was used for this example.

GtkListBox is well-suited for creating “button strips” — lists of controls for use in preference dialogs or settings panels. To create this style of list, use the .rich-list style class.

### Prerequisites

This App was compiled with `Vala 0.49.90.4-20ac2` against `gtk4 3.99`.


### Installing

Clone the repository then

```
- meson builddir
- ninja -C builddir
```

or open it in Gnome-builder
